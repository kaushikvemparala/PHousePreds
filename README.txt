To set up:
cd to wherever on ur computer u want the folder to be
then do:
git clone https://github.com/kaushikvemparala/PHousePreds.git
then if it asks for credentials u gotta enter ur github email for username.
for password go to ur user settings, scroll to the bottom of the menu and click on developer settings and click the personal access tokens drop down
then go to tokens and do generate new token (classic). fill all the shit out and copy the token and paste it for ur passwrd in terminal. 
Idk if the credentials shit will pop up now or later but whenever it does do that stuff.
Then, j navigate to the PHousePreds folder and do jupyter notebook. 
once ur done w ur changes, do these:
git add .
git commit -m "arsenals shit"
git push

whenever u wanna get new changes that i make do
git pull
